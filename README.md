dash-valid-component is a project based on Dash and Pydantic that simplifies the process of data validation by generating web cards for data validation. It allows users to define Pydantic's BaseModel and automatically create web cards for data validation using interface elements provided by dash-mantine-components.

## Features
- Automatically generate web cards for data validation based on Pydantic's BaseModel.
- Real-time form validation and user feedback.
- Easy integration with existing Dash applications.

## Installation
To install dash-valid-component, run the following command:
```bash
pip install dash-valid-component
```

## Usage
Here is a simple example of how to use the validation card in a Dash application:

```python
from dash_valid_component import create_validation_card
from pydantic import BaseModel
import dash
from dash import html

class User(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

app = dash.Dash(__name__)
validation_card = create_validation_card(User)

app.layout = html.Div([
    validation_card
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```
